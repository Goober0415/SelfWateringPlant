# SelfWateringPlant
This project is my second Midterm project in my emersive IOT deepdive bootcamp. It features a photon2 and works on the Particle dashboard. My wife suffers from ADHD and a very big love for her house plants. There are a few that are super dramatic in the bunch, one of those plants is called the pink nerve plant, or the fittonia, which means "it throws fits!!!" Putting my 3d designing skills to the test again, I decided to make the automated system in the shape of another one of my wife's favorite things, a Stanley cup. The straw will be the water pipe, there is a display screen on the lid, which displays all of the readings from the sensors for the plant and its environment. Additionally the Stanley cup is equipped with a reservoir to hold water for the plant, a BME sensor to gather temperature, humidity, and pressure data, an air quality control sensor which will be used to detect any pollutents in the air which can inhibit the growth and well being of the plant. 
# Motivation for this project
Better understand sensors and how I can use them to both display and gather data, but also make gadgets that can do something about off data readings for me. A self automated plant watering system is super helpful to any botanist, My ADHD wife who happens to be a botanist herself will love this new addition to her home in house garden!

# the pink nerve plant(Fittonia)
The perfect plant for this project, the name literally means, throws fits, and fits it throws! This species is very sensitive, she is very dramatic when she doesn't get enough water!
