# SelfWateringPlant
This project is my second Midterm project in my emersive IOT deepdive bootcamp. It features a photon2 and works on the Particle dashboard.
# Motivation for this project
Better understand sensors and how I can use them to both display and gather data, but also make gadgets that can do something about off data readings for me. A self automated plant watering system is super helpful to any botanist, My ADHD wife who happens to be a botanist herself will love this new addition to her home in house garden!
